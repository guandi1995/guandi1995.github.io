I received my Bachelor Degree of Purdue University majoring in Industrial Engineering
in May 2018. Yes, I am a boilermaker!! Now, I am a graduate student in UC San Diego,
majoring in Machine Learning and Data Science under the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering.

I have a strong passion in the field of machine learning and deep learning as many of
you do. So, I created this website for the purpose of sharing some thoughts and posts associated
with deep learning from my understanding point of views. Since the techniques of deep Learning
is changing tremendously those days, someone might get stuck or confused of where you are and start
asking yourself am I really suitable for learning this area or am I able to get a good
knowledge of deep learning at the end of days. Don't Worry! We are all same, same
confusion comes to my mind either. As long as we are interested in this field or
have strong passion to learn new stuffs, we are going to make it. Even though we
might not be as good as those experts, we can still learn a lot of stuffs and have
our own understanding of deep learning and how it changes our daily life.
