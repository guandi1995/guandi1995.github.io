In the following posts, we will discuss the neural networks in machine learning and deep learning, which is one of the most important topics in those areas. Neural networks are modeled as collections of neurons that are connected in an acyclic graph. It can be multiple layers in neural networks and the outputs of one layer will be the inputs of the following layer. For regular neural networks, the most common layer type is the fully-connected layer where neurons between two adjacent layers are fullt pairwise connected, but neurons within a single layer don't share the connections. Below are two examples of fully-connected layer of neural networks.
