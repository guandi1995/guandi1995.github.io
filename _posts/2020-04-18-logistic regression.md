Logistic regression is a technique in machine learning and is used to deal with the binary classification problem in supervised learning where the output of this type of problem has two-class value, i.e either 0 or 1. It is named for the function it used, which is logistic function or sigmoid function.

Consider a binary classification problem, given the input $$X$$, we want the estimated output that indicates which class the input is. Generally, we would find out the probability of the output to be 0 or 1 and then set up an threshold that can help us decide its estimated class. Therefore, we could denote the probability of the estimated output as $$\hat{y}$$.
