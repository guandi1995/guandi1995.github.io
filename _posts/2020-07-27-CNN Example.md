Since we have addressed the process of main building blocks in convolutional neural networks (CNN), now let's take a look at several classical and modern CNN architectures. In this post, we will mainly focus on the classical architectures such as  LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16 while modern network architectures such as Inception and ResNet will be introduced in the following posts.
