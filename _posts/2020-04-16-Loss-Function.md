Neural Networks leans to map a set of inputs to a set of outputs from training data. Given the training data, we usually calculate the weights for a neural network, but it is impossible to obtain the perfect weights. The approach to address this is by transforming the problem to optimization algorithm. It is an algorithm that is used to navigate the space of possible sets of weights the model may use in order to make good predictions.

But in the context of an optimization algorithm, the function that is used to evaluate a candidate solution is referred to as the objective function. Objective function is the function we want to minimize or maximize. In the context of machine learning or deep learning, we always want to minimize the function. That is why we always call this kind of objective function as cost function or loss function.

Machine learning and deep learning is to learn by means of a loss function.
